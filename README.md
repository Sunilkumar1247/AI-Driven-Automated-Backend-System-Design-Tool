# AI-Driven Automated Backend System Design Tool

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered tool for automating backend system design, reducing API design time by 60% and improving overall backend consistency. By leveraging AI, it allows for fast, scalable API generation while improving system throughput and response times.

## Features
- Automated API generation using AI.
- Integration with real-time data models to enhance system throughput by 30%.
- FastAPI integration for scalable API development.
- CI/CD pipeline setup to reduce deployment time by 40%.
- Backend optimization for improved cloud resource allocation by 15%.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Python
- **Frameworks**: FastAPI, TensorFlow
- **DevOps**: CI/CD Pipelines (Jenkins), Docker
- **Cloud**: AWS

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sunilkumar1247/AI-Backend-System-Design-Tool.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the backend system:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
4. Access the API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## Additional Notes
- CI/CD pipelines are configured using Jenkins for automatic deployment.
- TensorFlow models are used for real-time data analysis.
