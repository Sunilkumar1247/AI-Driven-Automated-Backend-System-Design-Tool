### Core Components

- **Frontend (React + GraphQL + Tailwind CSS)**: A responsive, intuitive UI with dynamic interactions for real-time design recommendations.
- **API Gateway (GraphQL + REST)**: Acts as the entry point for all frontend requests, routing them to appropriate AI/ML models or optimization modules.
- **AI Design Tutor**: Provides recommendations for backend design, learning from user input and system configurations.
- **Architecture Evolution Module**: Tracks changes in backend design and predicts future evolutions based on historical data.
- **Design Optimization Engine**: Ensures backend designs are optimized for performance and scalability.
- **Security Audit**: Conducts autonomous checks to ensure compliance with security protocols.
- **Performance Predictor**: Uses AI models to predict system performance and make real-time adjustments.
- **GPT Model & ML Models (TensorFlow, Scikit-learn)**: Leverages pre-trained models to offer predictions, optimizations, and backend design suggestions.
- **Collaboration Service**: Enables live coding and team collaboration.
- **Data Storage (PostgreSQL + Redis)**: Handles persistent storage of design data and caching for improved performance.

## Performance Benchmarks

We’ve run several benchmarks to measure the system's performance under different loads and use cases. The key metrics include:

- **Backend Response Time**: ~95ms (under normal load) | ~150ms (under high load)
- **AI Model Inference Time**: ~45ms per request
- **System Throughput**: 2000 requests/second (on a 4-core AWS EC2 instance)
- **Scalability**: Scales up to 10,000 concurrent users with minimal latency impact using Kubernetes auto-scaling.
